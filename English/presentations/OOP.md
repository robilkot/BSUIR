# Basics of OOP

- Everything is made up of classes and objects
- Class is a template for creating objects
- Classes have fields and methods

*OOP has some main concepts*

- Inheritance

# Incapsulation 🔐

Concept of enclosing parts of data inside of classes (sometimes called blackbox principle)
Classes have private, public members

*Example:*
Class car may have fields *model, engine* and methods *drive(), stop()*. All that is combined in one class.

# Polymorphism 🤟🏻🤟🏽🤟🏿

Concept of class having multiple forms.
Classes may serve different purposes.

*Example:*

A method may accept two integers and return an integer, or may take two floats and return a float. Depending on the parameters we provide calling method, we get a different outputs.

# Inheritance 👩‍👧

Classes can be derived from one another, preserving superclasses' fields and methods.

*Example:*
Class electric car derives from class car.
It derives such properties as *color, size, max. velocity*.
Electic car is subclass for class car.
Car is superclass for class electic car.

# Popular OOP languages

- Python
*for ease of learning and lots of libraries*
- Ruby
*for fast compilation and execution*
- C#
*for variety of applications and UI*
- Java
*for fast execution and being cross-platform*
